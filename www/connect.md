## Requirements

* Operate an autonomous system using a public RIR allocated ASN.
* Be good natured and friendly.
* Be willing to tolerate the service levels commiserate with a best-effort IX.
* Have a profile on peeringDB.com which includes which building you're in, a NOC email address, your prefix limits for IPv4 and IPv6, and your IRR as-set.
* Be able to light a 1000BASE-LX or 10Gbase-LR single mode cross connect into the IX. Hurricane Electric will cover the cost of the cross connect, so you only need to cover the cost of lighting your end of the cross connect.

The exchange does not charge a port fee, but that is only made possible by the generous support of the members of FCIX, so consider donating to FCIX in lieu of a membership fee if you find our services of value to you.
