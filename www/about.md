The FCIX is a best-effort Internet Exchange originally set up to reduce the number of needed cross-connects between a group of friends in the Hurricane Electric FMT2 colo facility.


## Architecture

The entire FCIX fabric is built as a VLAN on a single Cisco 6506. I know; very sophisticated.

The two route servers are both running Quagga on VMs spread across two hypervisors inside PhirePhly Design and Mojo Networks, respectively.
