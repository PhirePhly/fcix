## "The third largest IXP in Hurricane Electric FMT2!"

The FCIX is a best-effort Internet Exchange which was originally set up to reduce the number of needed cross-connects between a group of friends in the Hurricane Electric FMT2 colo facility, but has quickly grown into being an actual IXP.

First and foremost, FCIX was set up as an affordable way for networks to join an IXP.
Not every network can justify the non-zero expense of joining larger IXPs like [SFMIX](https://sfmix.org/) (which is still a good deal).
If you're a small network who can't afford MRC on your IX connections, then we're the IXP for you! [Hit us up](/connect/)!

## Architecture

FCIX is currently running on a single Arista DCS-7050S-64.
A second Arista has been aquired for a planned expansion into HE FMT1.

## History

* April, 2018 - IXP founded as a VLAN on PhirePhly Design's Cisco 6506
