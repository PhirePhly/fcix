### Are you really a cabal?

No. We started calling ourselves a cabal in jest, and the name stuck.
We also call ourselves the Oligarchs of Aisle Six, but that's obviously not right either.

### Are you trying to compete with other Internet Exchanges in the Bay Area?

No. If you're looking to join a local IX with a valuable mix of members, we strongly encourage you to join [SFMIX](https://sfmix.org/). We're just a group of network engineers saving some money on Ethernet cables.

### Can I join FCIX?

Sure. If you're willing to pay the cross-connect fee into PhirePhly Design's cabinet and bring your own optics to light it, I guess you can join. If you've got any spare optics to help out others, that'd also be nice.

### What's the MRC for joining FCIX?

$0/mo for 1x1Gbps, double that for anything faster.

### Why are you using a private ASN for an IX?

Because the FCIX was founded to save some amateurs some money, so paying for an ASN kind of goes against that objective. Do you have a spare ASN you're not using?
