## "The third largest IXP in Hurricane Electric FMT2!"

The FCIX is a free community-run Internet Exchange which was originally set up to reduce the number of needed cross-connects between a group of friends in the Hurricane Electric FMT2 colo facility, but has quickly grown to include other networks.
