The FCIX is a best-effort Internet Exchange originally set up to reduce the number of needed cross-connects between a group of friends in the Hurricane Electric FMT2 colo facility.

This Internet Exchange was created as a partly tongue-in-cheek way to save on cross-connects versus paying for a full dense mesh between a group of friends all running their own ASes.

## Architecture

The entire FCIX fabric is built on a single Cisco 6506. I know; very sophisticated.
