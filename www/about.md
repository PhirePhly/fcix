The FCIX is a best-effort Internet Exchange originally set up to reduce the number of needed cross-connects between a group of friends in the Hurricane Electric FMT2 colo facility.

This Internet Exchange was created as a partly tongue-in-cheek way to save on cross-connects versus paying for a full dense mesh between a group of friends all running their own ASes.

## FAQ

### Are you really a cabal?

No. We started calling ourselves a cabal in jest, and the name stuck.

### Are you trying to compete with other Internet Exchanges in the Bay Area?

No. If you're looking to join a local IX with a valuable mix of members, we strongly encourage you to join [SFMIX](https://sfmix.org/). We're just a group of network engineers saving some money on Ethernet cables.

### Can I join FCIX?

Sure. If you're willing to pay the cross-connect fee into PhirePhly Design's cabinet in FMT2, I guess you can join.
