### Are you really a cabal?

No. We started calling ourselves a cabal in jest, and the name stuck.
We also call ourselves the Oligarchs of Aisle Six, but that's obviously not true either.

### Can I join FCIX?

Sure. See the [connect](/connect/) page.

### What's the Monthly Recurring Cost for joining FCIX?

$0/mo for 1x1Gbps, double that for anything faster.

Don't worry; we take our level of service at these prices very seriously, and will always make sure to refund port fees for any outages suffered on the FCIX.

### How do you pronounce FCIX?

It isn't polite.

### Can I get a VPN tunnel into FCIX?

...

No.

### Do you support BCP214?

Yes! Despite being a cabal, we take blackholing of traffic very seriously, so BGP sessions are forced down and traffic drained before ports are taken offline for service.

### Do the route servers implement filtering?

Yes! Our route servers support IRR filtering and community-based redistribution filtering.
For more information on IRR filtering, see [our whitepaper on a quickstart to IRR](/whitepaper/2018/07/14/intro-to-irr-rpsl.html).
For more information on what communities our route servers support, see [the route server policy page](/rs-policy.html).
