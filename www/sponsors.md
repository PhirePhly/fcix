## Sponsors

Since FCIX is a project started and run solely by volunteers, what we do wouldn't be possible without the generous contributions by various vendors and organizations.

* [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/)
* [Flexoptix](https://www.flexoptix.net/)

## Swag

[We have our own T-shirts](https://teespring.com/stores/fcix)! Every sale supports FCIX, and who doesn't want to let it be known they're part of a cabal?

There are also usually FCIX stickers available in the Hurricane Electric FMT2 lobby. 

## Contributions

FCIX prides itself in being an affordable IXP without port fees, but that's only possible due to the generosity of our sponsors and members.  If you've always wanted to be a paying member of a cabal, and probably get yourself on some list somewhere, let us know. We accept PayPal and can also generate an invoice for sevices rendered if that would make contributing to FCIX easier for you.
