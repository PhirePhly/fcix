## Sponsors

Since FCIX is a project started and run solely by volunteers, what we do wouldn't be possible without the generous contributions by various vendors and organizations.

* [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com/)
* [FlexOptix](https://www.flexoptix.net/)

## Swag

[We have our own T-shirts](https://teespring.com/stores/fcix)! Every sale supports FCIX, and who doesn't want to let it be known they're part of a cabal?

## Contributions

FCIX isn't a registered non-profit (since that would kind of blow our whole scrappy secret organization aesthetic), but if you'd like to send us money to help cover all our personal expenses and probably get yourself on some list somewhere, [we accept PayPal](paypal.me/KennethFinnegan/20).
