### Are you really a cabal?

No. We started calling ourselves a cabal in jest, and the name stuck.
We also call ourselves the Oligarchs of Aisle Six, but that's obviously not true either.

### Are you trying to compete with other Internet Exchanges in the Bay Area?

No. If you're looking to join a local IX with a valuable mix of major members, we strongly encourage you to join [SFMIX](https://sfmix.org/). We're more or less just a group of network engineers trying to avoid our cross connect fees going quadratic. If you're a network with zero budget for ports on Internet Exchanges, then you're likely a good candidate for the Cabal. 

### Can I join FCIX?

Sure. See the [connect](/connect/) page.

### My network isn't in Hurricane Electric FMT2; can I still join?

No. We generally can't support VPN tunnels into the IXP. That's just more work for us without any actual routing improvement for the Internet. 

### What's the Monthly Recurring Cost for joining FCIX?

$0/mo for 1x1Gbps, double that for anything faster.

Don't worry; we take our level of service at these prices very seriously, and will always make sure to refund port fees for any outages suffered on the FCIX.

### Do you have anything faster than 1G?

Yes! We're in the process of migrating to some Arista 7050-64s, so we've got 10G ports available. It wouldn't really be a cabal without 10G Ethernet, now would it?

### How do you pronounce FCIX?

It isn't polite.

### Why are you using a private ASN for an IX?

FCIX is a very budget focused organization, so we originally started using a private use ASN. Our community has put together the money and funded a global ASN, so we are actually in the process of migrating to a real ASN soon!

### Why are you using AMPRnet IPv4 space?

FCIX was originally meant to just be an exchange for a few amateurs who happened to all run networks in the same aisle of a datacenter. That plan very quickly went out the window, which started work on the paperwork to get actual address blocks allocated for the exchange. Those prefixes have been received from ARIN, and a renumbering of the exchange is in the works.
