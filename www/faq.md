### Are you really a cabal?

No. We started calling ourselves a cabal in jest, and the name stuck.
We also call ourselves the Oligarchs of Aisle Six, but that's obviously not true either.

### Are you trying to compete with other Internet Exchanges in the Bay Area?

No. If you're looking to join a local IX with a valuable mix of major members, we strongly encourage you to join [SFMIX](https://sfmix.org/). We're more or less just a group of network engineers trying to avoid our cross connect fees going quadratic. If you're a network with zero budget for ports on Internet Exchanges, then you're likely a good candidate for the Cabal. 

### Can I join FCIX?

Sure. See the [connect](/connect/) page.

### My network isn't in Hurricane Electric FMT2; can I still join?

No? Well, technically yes, but I really don't understand why you'd want to spend all the money to get transport into the build just to join the cabal.

### What's the Monthly Recurring Cost for joining FCIX?

$0/mo for 1x1Gbps, double that for anything faster.

Don't worry; we take our level of service at these prices very seriously, and will always make sure to refund port fees for any outages suffered on the FCIX.

### Do you even really have anything faster than 1G?

Well... Look, we're running on a Cisco 6506. Our 10G ports are literally running [XENPAKs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XENPAK), so needless to say, 10G ports are in short supply. Let's start on a 1G port and we can go from there.

### How do you pronounce FCIX?

It isn't polite.

### Why are you using a private ASN for an IX?

Because FCIX was founded to save some amateurs some money, so paying for an ASN kind of goes against that objective. Do you have a spare ASN you're not using?

### Why are you using AMPRnet IPv4 space?

Because we all have amateur radio licenses, and we had this /24 left over from a previous project. Do you have a spare /24 you're not using?
